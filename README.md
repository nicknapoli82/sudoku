# Sudoku

Just a simple Sudoku puzzle solver in c. 

For me, the actual puzzle was secondary to my entertaining the idea of using a function queue can be generalized to take a function and environment, and just run it. So the puzzle itself was just an excuse to impliment that alone. 

The function queue was actually simpler to create than I realized though. So ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Regardless. I am able to add solvers as I see fit.
